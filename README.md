# dotfiles.fish
This repo contains my dotfiles based on dotfiles made by [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles.fish)

# Installation
To install all dotfiles you have only to run `./scripts/bootstrap.fish` ( or `fish ./scripts/bootstrap.fish`). 

To upgrade dotfiles type `git pull origin master` and then re-install all dotfiles.
